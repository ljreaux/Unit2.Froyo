# Unit2.Froyo
Block 15 Workshop
This app takes in user input for frozen yogurt orders and keeps track of the number of each flavor that has been ordered. It takes input as a string seperated by commas, then converts that to an array. Then the array is checked against the available flavors (an object), and the value is updated accordingly. If you enter an invalid flavor, the app will tell you to enter a valid Froyo flavor.
